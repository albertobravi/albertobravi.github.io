Since 2007, I work on the internet creating simple and complex applications, using technology to ensure high availability, reduced consumption of resources, agile maintenance and scalability.

Over the years I have created personal projects that have made me learn new technologies and areas of interest that normally would not have known.

Since 2010 I work for a large Italian company, which owns sites of national fame, creating sites, implementing new features, interfacing with external suppliers, solving problems of any kind, using many technologies are aimed at ensuring stability sites, visited by millions of users daily.
